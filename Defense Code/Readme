This project was completed utilizing repy from the Seattle Testbed. Assignment was to create defensive code, a sort of reference monitor
which checked 8 byte parity for every write command.

Use of this code in any form for academic purposes is considered cheating, which is not only unfair to your classmates,
but as well as yourself. Use at your own risk.
